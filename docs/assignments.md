title: Computational Social Science 2023
tagline: DTU 02467 Computational Social Science Course Spring 2023
description: A course led by Laura Alessandretti on Computational Social Science
---


Computational Social Science is an interdisciplinary field that studies society and human behaviour through computational analyses and large-scale data.
Throughout this BSc course, students in Artificial Intelligence and Data will familiarise with topics and approaches that are central to the discipline
and will learn techniques to collect, analyse and model behavioural data for tackling social science questions.  

<!--
The course focuses on theoretical aspects via lectures and reading, but has also a strong practical component, including programming exercises and a project assignment.
Classes are thought in a flipped classroom style, and the course is divided in two parts.  
During the first eight weeks, students will have access to a Jupyter Notebook that contains all the material for each weekly class, including the video lectures and the exercises.
Students will be able to view the  video lectures before (or during) the class session, so the in-class time can be devoted to exercises, projects, or discussions.
There will be two written homework assignments that will involve solving a subset of the exercises you have worked on during the class.  
In the last four weeks, students will work on developing a group project assignment, which involves the analysis of a dataset and a topic of their choice.

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

- Working with html and css
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site

With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you just write things in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[GitHub](https://github.com) hosts the site for you, and you just push
material to your GitHub repository with `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push`.

If you love [git](https://git-scm.com/) and
[GitHub](https://github.com), you'll love
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), too.

The sites use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [gem](https://rubygems.org/), to
convert Markdown files to html, and this part is done
automatically when you push the materials to the `gh-pages` branch
of a GitHub repository.

The [GitHub](https://pages.github.com) and
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) documentation is great, but I thought it
would be useful to have a minimal tutorial, for those who just want to
get going immediately with a simple site. To some readers, what GitHub
has might be simpler and more direct.  But if you just want to create
a site like the one you're looking at now, read on.

Start by reading the [Overview page](pages/overview.html), which
explains the basic structure of these sites. Then read
[how to make an independent website](pages/independent_site.html). Then
read any of the other things, such as
[how to test your site locally](pages/local_test.html).

- [Overview](pages/overview.html)
- [Making an independent website](pages/independent_site.html)
- [Making a personal site](pages/user_site.html)
- [Making a site for a project](pages/project_site.html)
- [Making a jekyll-free site](pages/nojekyll.html)
- [Testing your site locally](pages/local_test.html)
- [Resources](pages/resources.html)

If anything here is confusing (or _wrong_!), or if I've missed
important details, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site/issues), or (even
better) fork [the GitHub repository for this website](https://github.com/kbroman/simple_site),
make modifications, and submit a pull request.
